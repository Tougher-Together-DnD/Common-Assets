Tools to Use:
[Firefox Addon: VTT Enhancement Suite](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/roll20-enhancement-suite/).

It has tools that allow exporting and importing of game files, thereby storing the stuff locally on my own machines. These files lso make it easier and more consistent to move comman asets between games. Even Games not owned by the same person.

[Discord](https://discord.com/)

It is better quality Video and Voice chat. No need to overload the Browser with all the Rendering it already must do.

[Github](https://github.com/Tougher-Together-DnD)

I use Github to store my images on the web. An alternative for images may be [Imgur](https://imgur.com/).

Imgur has a content delivery network (CDN) making loading **Hot Linked** images faster. This can speed up loading times when a game needs to fetch many images external to the Roll20 servers. It is helpful to save these files as WEBP for smaller file sizes.

Using WEBP will show broken links in your Roll20 Image library. but the images will still dispaly in game. One does not have this problem with PNG's, but bigger files-longer waits occur.

Added benefit of linking an image is when it is over written the corresponding images within Roll20 are also changed. Allowing a one point of interest to populate changes across all your games.

I use Github to host my scripts and config files as well. Text files are not supported by Imgur.
