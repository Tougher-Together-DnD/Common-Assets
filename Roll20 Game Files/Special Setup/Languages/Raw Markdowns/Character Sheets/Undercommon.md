### About
Undercommon was a trade language spoken by the majority of intelligent races native to the Underdark. Speakers of Undercommon included the aboleth, choker, chuul, cloaker, delver, drider, drow, duergar, dwarf, githyanki, githzerai, grimlock, kobold, kuo-toa, orc, rakshasa, roper, svirfneblin, and mind flayer races.

This language was originally created by slaves of the Drow to communicate between each other as slaves of various races began interacting. It eventually grew to the point that it became a trade language within the "lesser" Underdark races, since so many could speak at least some of it.

Drow are generally reluctant to speak Undercommon, since the existence of this tongue is actually an insult to Xanalress. An alternative the Drow of Arelith use is putting in "Drow words" in their sentences, even when they just speak common, to give it an extra touch.

Gnolls do not know Undercommon, for they are not originally from the Underdark, nor have Drow kept them as slaves often.
