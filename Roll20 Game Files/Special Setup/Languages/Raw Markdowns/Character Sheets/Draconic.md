### About
Draconic was the language of dragons. Dragons called their language **Glav** (meaning "speech/converse"). Other native speakers include members of draconic-related races, such as kobolds and dragonborn, and members of reptilian races such as lizardfolk and troglodytes. The language was also used as a primary means of arcane notation throughout Toril.

Over the eons many dialects of Draconic have formed.

### Sound
Draconic was a language of hard consonants and sibilants that usually sounded like hissing when spoken, like *sj*, *ss*, and *sv*. It also included a sound similar to a creature clearing its throat, *ach*.

Draconic words were emphasized on the first syllable, and speakers of Draconic expressed important ideas by stressing the beginnings and the ends of words. Dragons often used this when referring to themselves, or when they wanted to command, warn, threaten, or otherwise make their point clear.

### Script
Dragons are long lived with superior memories, writing was of little importance. However when communicating with less long living people an alphabet did emerge to record messages preserved across generations. Reminiscent of letters crudely scratched into a surface by a claw, that alphabet is Iokharic.

Dragons believed *Iokharic* was created by the dragon god Asgorath so his creations could record their impressions of the world he hoped they would inherit. Though that is unlikely.

The script is believed to have been influenced by the dwarven runes, but dragons themselves dismissed such a connection.

More distasteful to dragons is that elven scholars theorize that kobolds, rather than dwarves, were the ones who actually created Iokharic. As it was widely believed that the earliest kobolds served dragons, learning dragon ways.
