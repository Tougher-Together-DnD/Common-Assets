### About
<br>
<div class='descriptive'>
There exists a language so dire, so inherently full of spite, malice, corruption, and hatred that it is simply called the Dark Speech. This is the secret language of evil gods, so foul and so potent that even demons and devils refrain from its use, lest it consume them.

~Book of Vile Darkness
<br>
</div>

Each word is full of dread power that could be used to provoke emotions, empower magic, or corrupt physical objects. The warlock invocation *baleful utterance* is a mere syllable of Dark Speech.

### Sound
Conveyed usually between telepathic beings the verbal and somatic parts of Dark Speech are layered atop each other in seemingly contradictory riddles and with bold attention getting statements that illicit dread, depression, guilt, and/or self deprecation.

### Script
Because the Gnomish language has rich nuances and depth of representation, when Dark Speech is written by mortals they use Gnomish pictographs. However, the only way to properly convey the language is with esoteric symbology.
