### About
Minotaurs were a strong and combative race of monstrous humanoids resembling bull–human hybrids that were rare in Faerun. Many minotaurs worshiped the demon lord Baphomet and were not allowed in many cities because of this known factor. Most moved toward the chaotic evil alignment, and did not work well in groups, packs, or even parties due to their solo hunter-like nature.

Minotaurs were carnivores, but preferred the taste of human flesh. They loved to dwell within maze-like caverns or ruins, where their innate sense of direction prevented them from getting lost. They lured travelers into their maze-like homes, where the minotaurs had the advantage over their unfortunate prey.[citation needed]

Many minotaurs couldn't be trusted with non-minotaur races at times, since most humanoids were their meal, and they would do anything for a quick bite out of a sleeping party member, slave owner, or wandering villager. They were not welcomed in any cities, and received an immediate death sentence, or a stoning if caught. Or worse, they were hunted by multiple hunters seeking the thrill of giving the beasts a taste of their own medicine.
