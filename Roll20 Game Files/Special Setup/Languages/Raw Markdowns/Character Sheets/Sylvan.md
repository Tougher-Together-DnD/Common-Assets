### About
Sylvan is often seen as the language of nature, as its speakers are often nature spirits and creatures. The language itself is fairly old, and has changed very little throughout the ages. It flows easily, similarly to Elvish; in fact many linguists believe that the Elvish language is derived from Sylvan. 

### Sound
More to come...

### Script
Fey creatures do not usually write anything down, being long lived and apart from the concerns of the mundane world. When they do Often times it is transcribed in Elvish script. However, the evolution of a script by Noble Fey in the Sellie and Unsellie court have created the Eladrin script.
