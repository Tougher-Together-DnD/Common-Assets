### Dark Speech
>There exists a language so dire, so inherently full of spite, malice, corruption, and hatred that it is simply called the Dark Speech. This is the secret language of evil gods, so foul and so potent that even demons and devils refrain from its use, lest it consume them.
>  
>~Book of Vile Darkness

Each word is full of dread power that could be used to provoke emotions, empower magic, or corrupt physical objects. The warlock invocation *baleful utterance* is a mere syllable of Dark Speech.

Because the Gnomish language has rich nuances and depth of representation, when Dark Speech is written by mortals they use Gnomish pictographs. The only way to properly convey the language is with esoteric symbology.

It is an extremely complex, highly contextual language, relying heavily on more than just sound, but also tone and inflection. It utilizes body language, smells, trilling, gurgling, and a whole manner of unpleasantness that most mortals struggle with performing.

Fiends with multiple mouths, and other body parts find the language easier to learn than mortals.
