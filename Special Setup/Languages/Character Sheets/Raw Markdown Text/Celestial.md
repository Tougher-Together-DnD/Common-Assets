### Celestial

Celestial is spoken by the good aligned beings from the outer planes (outsiders). When it was brought to Toril, it had a beautiful, yet alien quality to it. Expressions, patterns and structures were very different from the way humans think.

Clerics of the Forgotten Realms who learn the language use a logographic system of writing, with pictographs to represent concepts, to record Celestial phrases.

Historically this "alphabet" was used to transcribe the Mulhorandi language, one of the first human languages. Known for its slow, thick evolution using prefixes and suffixes instead of word order to convey meaning. Except in Thay, where Mulhorandi was written in Infernal (the script of demons and devils).

More recently it is sometimes written with a collection of 22 runes, each letter being composed of circles connected by lines.
