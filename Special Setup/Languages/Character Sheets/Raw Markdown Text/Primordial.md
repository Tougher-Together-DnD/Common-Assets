### About
Primordial was the language of primordials and elementals. The Giant language was a debased form of it. The Abyssal language was a form of Primordial warped and twisted by the evil of the Abyss.

It was also considered a language family, so that the elemental languages Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran were considered a group of dialects of Primordial. They were sufficiently similar that creatures who understood one of those dialects could understand the others as well.

Primordial used the Barazhad script or the Dwarvish script.
