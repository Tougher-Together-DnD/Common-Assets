### About
The gnomish language, also known as Gnim, is spoken almost exclusively by the gnomes.

Gnim had a simple structure and fluid tones. Most gnomes had a truly daunting vocabulary, however, with extremely fine degrees of distinction in, for example, kinds of love or shades of green. Their language is thus ideal for academic, artistic, and engineering pursuits, and it was widely used in academic circles. Even among other races, sages consider Gnim to be a "scholar's language."

Gnomish writings and literature cover a staggering variety of topics. 

### Sound
Gnomish sounds like softer Dwarven, and less complicated than Elvish. Yet this obscures the range of the language, which relies on order, pitch, sound region, various copulas, and length of vowel sounds to communicate a word. Subtly differences of any of those features could be an entirely different word and meaning.

### Script
Gnomish was originally written in Dethek, but as the language and vocabulary of Gnome culture grew so did its written expression. Gnomes utilize a pictographic script, where each grapheme can be adjusted with dots and lines to change its represented phoneme, consequently the meaning of the resulting word.
