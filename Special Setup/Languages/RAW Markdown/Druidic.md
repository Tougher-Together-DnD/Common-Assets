### About
All druids are taught to speak Druidic, and are forbidden from teaching it to anyone else.

Two known dialects of Druidic are Drueidan, spoken by the Fearun druids who worship Silvanus, and Dealic, spoken by the Moonsea druids who worship Earthmother (aka Chauntea).

Druidic is actually a language composed of two distinct, but similar languages. The vast majority of druids speak Drueidan; those from the Moonshaes speak a language called Daelic.

Silvanus wanted did not want his followers to divide themselves as mortals drew and redrew country borders and alienated themselves from each other with different languages. So he made a deal with the other gods for all druids to speak a common tongue, thereby establishing a culture of shared language and ideas that transcended the lines drawn by societies.

To learn druidism naturally imparts learning about nature and Druidic.

### Sound
Druidic is derived from the sounds of nature, reinforcing the rhythmic, circular, and harmony of life itself. The "words" it uses repeat syllables with slightly different inflection, high vowel sounds end in sharp, crunching consonants. Or its reverse of a Hard consonant that precedes a fading vowel. Its not the lyrical, sweeping sounds of Elvish. More akin to the crashing of waves along the shore, the rustling of leaves by the wind, the fawn calling its mother. A melody the nature lover can appreciate.

Druidic entails animal sounds as well. For instance, a druid when conveying "early morning" would use a word that sounds like the call of a blackbird. One of the first birds to participate in the Dawn Chorus. Because of this a broken form of Druidic can often be spoken by druids even in animal form.

Words such as: Shillelagh (shil-lail-lee), Sleveen (sligh-bhin), Shawn Van Vocht (sean-bhean-bhocht)

### Script
Druids concern themselves with nature and the present moment. Everything is cyclic. There is nothing to record for prosperity because there is nothing new under the sun. What has been, will be and vice versa. Living in the moment only requires a basic knowledge that any sentient creature can attain with experience, or perish trying.

Druids were also forbidden from teaching Druidic, and writing their knowledge down.

As such Druidic does not have a script per say. But only around 30 pictographs denoting words or phrases. These symbols are representative of what they evoke. A *tree* symbol means "tree". By combining these symbols a druid can convey a simple message to others. For instance, a druid will writing the symbols for *person* next to the symbol for *tree*, this means "Rest here".

Begs the question, "Why alert other druids to rest?". Probably because the trail ahead is going to be a lot tougher. So one may also interpret the message as, "Steep terrain ahead".
